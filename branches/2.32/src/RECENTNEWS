CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.32.33

* Fix to the Mac GUI: the bigarray library is now required
* Improvement to the code for resuming directory transfers:
  - make sure file information (permissions, ...) has been properly set
    when using a previously transferred temp file
  - make sure previously transferred directories are writable
  (other changes made in the developer version of Unison require a
  protocol change)
* Fixed bug in Lwt_unix.run which could make it fail with a Not_found
  exception (see [Not_found raised in tryCopyMovedFile] errors)

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.32.32

* Got rid of the 16MiB marshalling limit by marshalling to a bigarray

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.32.30

* Case sensitivity information put in the archive (in a backward
  compatible way) and checked when the archive is loaded
* Text UI: during update detection, display status by updating a
  single line rather than generating a new line of output every so
  often.  That should be less confusing.
* Text UI: in repeat mode, don't save the archives when there is no
  update.  Indeed, in this mode, we should minimize the amount of work
  performed and it is unlikely that the archives have changed much.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.32.25

* Fixed quotation of paths and names when writing to a preference file
* Workaround for bug in new "select" implementation in Ocaml 3.11
  (select fails with EPIPE error when monitoring a remotely closed
   file descriptor)

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.32.23

* Added some missing convertUnixErrorsToTransient

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.32.19

* Small documentation fix suggested by mszsummer.



-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.32.12

* Fixed bug in GTK UI: buttons could be incorrectly activated back during
  synchronization
* Improved error message when trying to synchronize a symlink to a
  Windows machine
* Uses improved emulation of "select" call provided by Ocaml 3.11
  under Windows (the GUI should not freeze as much during synchronization)
* Improved Unison icon

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.32.11

* Fix up docs.
