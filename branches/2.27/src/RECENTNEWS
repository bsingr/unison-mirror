CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.43

* Tidying for new export of 2.27 (still as beta release for the moment).


-------------------------------
* Ignore all-whitespace lines in preference files

* Apply experimental patch from Craig Federighi, which seems to fix
  the deadlocks and crashes in new OSX UI.  (Actually, this is a major
  rewrite and cleanup of the whole Cocoa UI.)  Thanks, Craig!!!

* Small fix to ctime (non-)handling in update detection under windows
  with fastcheck.  This *might* fix the bug that Karl M. has reported.
