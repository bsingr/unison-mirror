CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.48

* Small improvement to error message when no archive files are
  found (thanks to Norman Ramsey).

* Patch from Karl M for GTK2 UI:
     1) reverts the problematic (when no profile is used)
        reloadProfile on the restart button.
     2) it adds a reloadProfile call after the detectCmd for
        rescanning unsynchronized items.
     3) it turns off confirmBigDeletes on a rescan and checks it
        before issuing a warning popup.
     4) it adjusts the status results width so that everything fits.

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.47

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.43

* Apply experimental patch from Craig Federighi, which seems to fix
  the deadlocks and crashes in new OSX UI.  (Actually, this is a major
  rewrite and cleanup of the whole Cocoa UI.)  Thanks, Craig!!!

* Small fix to ctime (non-)handling in update detection under windows
  with fastcheck.  This *might* fix the bug that Karl M. has reported.
