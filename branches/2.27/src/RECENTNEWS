CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.140

Backport to stable release:
* Fixed bug resulting in slow performances when transferring a file
  using our rsync implementation from a 64-bit architecture to a
  32-bit architecture.
* Fixed bug in Lwt_unix.run which could make it fail with a Not_found
  exception (see [Not_found raised in tryCopyMovedFile] errors)
* Properly deals with non-conformant AppleDouble files produced
  by Mac OS X.
* Fixed bug that results in Unison missing ressource fork changes

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.109

Backport to stable release:
* Ignore one hour differences for deciding whether a file may have
  been updated.  This avoids slow update detection after daylight
  saving time changes under Windows.  This makes it slightly more
  likely to miss an update, but that should be safe enough.
* Improved Unison icon under Windows
* Fixed quotation of paths and names when writing to a preference file
* Case sensitivity information put in the archive (in a backward
  compatible way) and checked when the archive is loaded
* Uses improved emulation of "select" call provided by Ocaml 3.11
  under Windows (the GUI does not freeze as much during synchronization)

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.101

* Applied a patch from Karl M to make the GTK2 version build with
  OCaml 3.11 on Windows.

* Added some extra debugging code to remote.ml to give more
  informative error messages when people encounter the longstanding
  "assert failed during file transfer" bug.

* Applied patch from Antoine Reilles for NetBSD compilation

* Makefile tidying

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.74

* Added 'make docs' to top-level Makefile

-------------------------------
CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.27.68

* Unison can sometimes fail to transfer a file, giving the unhelpful
  message "Destination updated during synchronization" even though the
  file has not been changed.  This can be caused by programs that
  change either the file's contents *or* the file's extended
  attributes without changing its modification time.  I'm not sure
  what is the best fix for this -- it is not Unison's fault, but it
  makes Unison's behavior puzzling -- but at least Unison can be more
  helpful about suggesting a workaround (running once with 'fastcheck'
  set to false).  The failure message has been changed to give this
  advice.

* Upgraded to GPL version 3 and added copyright notice to
  documentation files.
